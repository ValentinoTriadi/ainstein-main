- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB for persistent vector storage
- **AI/ML**: LlamaIndex for advanced document retrieval and processing
- **Language Models**: OpenAI GPT integration for intelligent responses
- **Data Processing**: LangChain for document processing pipelines
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containerization with docker-compose
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging system for monitoring
- **Language**: Python 3.13+

### How to Run

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- OpenAI API key
- Docker (optional)

#### Local Development
```bash
# Navigate to AI directory
cd ainstein-ai

# Setup environment
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Add your educational documents
cp -r /path/to/docs ./docs/
cp -r /path/to/source ./src/

# Run the API server
python -m app.main
```

#### Docker Deployment
```bash
cd ainstein-ai
docker-compose up --build
```

#### Available Endpoints

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The Ainstein platform follows a microservices architecture where each component serves a specific purpose:

1. **AI Pipeline** processes and understands educational content
2. **Backend API** manages data, users, and business logic  
3. **Mobile App** provides the user interface and experience

All components communicate through well-defined APIs and share a common authentication system for seamless user experiences.
